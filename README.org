* MESA Website
This is the raw version of the new (as of March 2014, revision 6188)
website for the MESA stellar evolution code.  One of the main goals is
to help get new users started more quickly.

You can [[http://mesa.sourceforge.net][view the site here]].
** Contributing
Did you find an error?  Do you see something that can be improved?  Do
you have other materials you've written yourself that you think could
be incorporated?  Send them to me.
*** Email Me
If you subscribe to the mesa-users mailing list, you should have no
trouble finding my email address.
*** Contribute on GitHub
Clone this repo and send me a pull request.
** Repository Layout
This site uses the [[http://jekyllrb.com/][jekyll]] static site generator.  (The old site used
webgen.) 
*** ??-<name>.markdown
These files are the main pages of the site.  They are written in
Markdown and then the HTML pages are generated from these files.
*** assets/
This directory contains images, movies, etc.
*** _config.yml
This file contains options to control the configuration of jekyll.
*** css/
This directory contains the CSS files.  (They could use a good cleanup
from someone who knows modern CSS.)
*** _includes/
This directory contains snippets like the site header (head.html),
left side bar (leftside.html) and right news bar (news.html).
*** _layouts/
This directory has HTML templates that control the overall layout of
the site.
*** _plugins/
This directory contains plug-ins (written in Ruby), which allow one to
extend the functionality of jekyll.
*** _posts/
This directory contains a Markdown file for each of the MESA news
posts that appear in the right hand sidebar.
*** _site/
This directory should not be under version control, but will be
created once you run jekyll.  It contains the static version of the
website, which is what is copied to the sourceforge server.
** Generating
If you're making significant changes to the site, you probably want to
see the effects of your changes as you go along.  You can generate and
view a version of the site on your own machine.

First, install a current version (1.9+) of ruby, using whichever tools
are appropriate for your OS (e.g., port, brew, apt-get, pacman, etc.).
This will come with rubygems (a ruby package manager).

Next, install the following three gems.  (Rubygems will take care of
installing their dependencies).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
gem install jekyll
gem install therubyracer
gem install nokogiri
gem install parslet
#+END_EXAMPLE

Next, clone this git repository.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
git clone https://github.com/jschwab/mesa-website
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now, change to the mesa-website directory and tell jekyll to serve a
local copy of the site for you.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
jekyll serve --watch
#+END_EXAMPLE
Visit 0.0.0.0:4000 in your web browser to see the site.  As you edit
the files, the site will be regenerated to reflect the changes you've
made.  Read the jekyll documentation to learn more.

Once you've finished making your changes, commit them and then send me
a pull request or email me a patch.
** Publishing
Email me if you want to know about how the site is published to
sourceforge.
** Doing a MESA release
The following things need to be done when a new MESA release occurs.
*** Edit _config.yml
Update the version number to the current release.
*** Check the tutorial 
Make a copy of the star/work directory and run the default inlists
with the new MESA version. Check to make sure that the output roughly
agrees with what is written in 03-staring.markdown.  If not, update
the tutorial to reduce possible confusion for new users.
*** Add a news post
Copy an existing release newspost (e.g.,
_posts/2014-06-08-r6596.markdown) and update the date and release
number.  Briefly summarize the release notes, mentioning any major
changes or issues that require user intervention.  Link to the mailing
list post announcing the new release.
*** Update the defaults files
Copy the defaults files for the latest release.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cp $MESA_DIR/star/defaults/*.defaults _includes/
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now run the provided parser/converter
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ruby parseDefaults.rb
#+END_EXAMPLE
*** Upload a new zip file to sourceforge
Make a zip file of the latest release.  Here's an example script to do
that.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

do_one() {

    MESA_SVN=/home/jschwab/Software/mesa-svn
    MESA_FILENAME=mesa-r$1

    svn export -r $1 ${MESA_SVN} ${MESA_FILENAME}

    zip -r ${MESA_FILENAME}.zip ${MESA_FILENAME}
    rsync -e ssh ${MESA_FILENAME}.zip frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/mesa/releases

    rm ${MESA_FILENAME}.zip
    rm -rf ${MESA_FILENAME}

}

do_one 6596
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you need to adjust the modification date of the zipfile, here's a
sketch how to do so.

Get the modification date from the svn logs:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
svn log -r 6596 ${MESA_SVN} | grep -oE "[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2} [0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2} -[0-9]{4}"
#+END_EXAMPLE

Get a shell on sourceforge:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ssh -t jschwab,mesa@shell.sourceforge.net create
#+END_EXAMPLE

In the shell, touch the file with the date:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
touch --date="2014-06-06 19:30:30 -0700" mesa-r6596.zip
#+END_EXAMPLE
