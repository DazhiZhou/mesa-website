Jakub Ostrowski published a new [MESA installation tutorial on YouTube][youtube].

As he announced on mesa-users:

> I recorded the process of installing new version of MESA with some extended commentary. The vid is rather long but together with my [updated installation guide](http://mesastar.org/teaching-materials/basics-of-the-mesa-evolution-code/installation-guide/view) it could be helpful for some people.

You can see the full [announcement here][announcement].
