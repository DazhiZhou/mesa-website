title:  New MESA SDK Version
categories: mesasdk
---

Version 20170802 is now available for 64-bit Linux and OS X from the
[SDK website][mesasdk].

If you’re currently using the MESA SDK, there’s no immediate need to
upgrade; but the new SDK brings a few benefits:

  + The gdb debugger and valgrind memory checker are now included with the SDK.

  + The ffmpeg movie compiler is now back in the Mac OSX version of
  the SDK, along with the images_to_movie.sh script — these allow the
  straightforward creation of movies from sequences of images.
