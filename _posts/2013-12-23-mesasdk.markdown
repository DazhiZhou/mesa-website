It’s a Festivus miracle -- with great pleasure I can announce the
release of a new MESA SDK! Version 20131223 is now available for
64-bit Linux and OS X from the [SDK website][mesasdk].  As usual,
there’s no burning need to upgrade to this latest version; but on the
flip side, a number of important compiler issues have been fixed.
