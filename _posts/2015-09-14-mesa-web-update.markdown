Carl Fields and collaborators have announced
[several updates][jul-post] to MESA-Web since its release, including
an [exciting update][sep-post] that allows users to specify an RGB and
AGB mass loss prescription and efficiency.  All runs also now include
[a mp4 movie][movie-post] of a grid of diagrams constructed using your
data.  This grid will include an abundance profile, HR diagram, and
many more, making it easier than ever to visualize your data!
